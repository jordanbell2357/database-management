-- Problem order does not match problem type. Problem types are mixed in the document.

-- Problem 1
-- List details of orders and employees in January 2021. Show an order even if no employee exists for the order.
-- The result should contain the order number, order date, employee number, and employee name (first and last).
-- Use LEFT JOIN keywords to refer to the table to preserve.

 FROM OrderTbl LEFT JOIN Employee ON Employee.EmpNo = OrderTbl.EmpNo
 WHERE OrdDate BETWEEN '1-Jan-2021' AND '31-Jan-2021';

-- Problem 2
-- List details of orders and employees in January 2021. Show an order even if no employee exists for the order.
-- The result should contain the order number, order date, employee number, and employee name (first and last).
-- Use RIGHT JOIN keywords to refer to the table to preserve.

 FROM Employee RIGHT JOIN OrderTbl ON Employee.EmpNo = OrderTbl.EmpNo
 WHERE OrdDate BETWEEN '1-Jan-2021' AND '31-Jan-2021';

-- Problem 3
-- List the customer number and name of Washington state customers who have not placed orders.
-- Identify the problem type and words in the problem statement matching the text pattern.

-- Insert a new customer without orders for this problem.
