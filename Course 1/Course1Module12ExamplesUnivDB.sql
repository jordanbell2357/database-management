-- PostgreSQL and Oracle execution
-- These examples appear in the lecture notes of Module 12.

-- Lesson 2, Part 2 examples
-- Example 1
-- List offerings of information system (IS) courses. 
-- The result should include the offer number, course number, faculty number, faculty first name, and
-- faculty last name. Include an offering even if a faculty is not assigned to teach the offering.
-- Use LEFT JOIN keywords

SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, Offering.FacNo,  
       FacFirstName, FacLastName

-- Example 2
-- List offerings of information system (IS) courses.

-- Example 3
-- Perform full outer join on faculty and student tables.
-- Compare faculty and student on faculty number to student number.
-- The result should contain the faculty number, faculty first name, faculty last name, faculty salary
-- student number, student first name, student last name, and student GPA.
