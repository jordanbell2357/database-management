-- The first solution is preferred because it involves one less table. 
-- However, credit for the second answer as it involves different join operations.

SQL statements with errors or poor formatting

1.
-- Original statement
-- Semantic error: missing join condition (eventrequest-eventplan)

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
  AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno 
  AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
  AND facname = 'Football stadium' 
  AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

-- Corrected statement

SELECT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
  AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno 
  AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
  AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
  AND facname = 'Football stadium' 
  AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

2.
-- Original statement
-- Redundancy error: GROUP BY clause not needed

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 4000
  AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno 
GROUP BY eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost;

-- Corrected statement with no GROUP BY clause

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 4000
  AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno;

3.
-- Original statement
-- Redundancy error: extra table (employee)

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
  AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno 
  AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
  AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno 
  AND facname = 'Football stadium';

-- Corrected statement

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan
WHERE estaudience > 5000
  AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno
  AND eventplan.eventno = eventrequest.eventno 
  AND facname = 'Football stadium';

4.
-- Original statement
-- Syntax errors: misspelled keyword (BETWEN) and unqualified name (eventno)

SELECT DISTINCT eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, eventplan
WHERE estaudience BETWEN 5000 AND 10000
  AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno 
  AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
  AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

-- Corrected statement
-- Note: eventno can be qualified with either eventrequest or eventplan table

SELECT DISTINCT eventrequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost
FROM eventrequest, employee, eventplan
WHERE estaudience BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000
  AND eventplan.empno = employee.empno 
  AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno
  AND empname = 'Mary Manager';

5.
-- Original statement with poor coding practices
-- Poor clause and condition alignment
-- Incompatible constant in WHERE condition: estaudience = '10000'

      SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, resname, 
resourcecnt, timestart, timeend
    FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, 
eventplanline, resourcetbl
     WHERE estaudience = '10000' AND eventplan.planno = 
eventplanline.planno AND eventrequest.facno 
= facility.facno
      AND facname = 
'Basketball arena' AND 
   eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno;

-- Rewritten statement with improved coding practices
-- Note: many ways to reformat the statement
-- Should align clauses and conditions
-- Numeric constant in WHERE condition: estaudience = 10000

  SELECT eventplan.planno, lineno, resname, resourcecnt, timestart, timeend
    FROM eventrequest, facility, eventplan, eventplanline, resourcetbl
    WHERE estaudience = 10000
      AND eventplan.planno = eventplanline.planno 
      AND eventrequest.facno = facility.facno

      AND eventplanline.resno = resourcetbl.resno
      AND eventrequest.eventno = eventplan.eventno;
